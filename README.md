# Skills-Programming---Group-Project
This program lets the user choose a number of listed stocks taken directly from Yahoo Finance. It utilises this data to compare the portofolio of stocks chosen based on a number of financial and operational KPIs. With this tool, the user can enter the number of companies he wants, and analyse them with the KPIs that we believe are essential for a fundamental analysis. The second phase of the programme allows to analyse the returns of each company in relation to the market itself, i.e. the daily returns. These returns are adjusted on the same basis so that they are comparable to each other. Finally, the last step in the analysis is to define the sensitivity of a company in relation to the sensitivity of the market. The indicator used in this last step is the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets and is used for pricing the risky securities.
